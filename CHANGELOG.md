## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pkg/configdiff` analysis engine (bootstrapped from config-diff-explainer):
  deterministic, offline config diff analysis with risk findings, rollback
  and validation plans, operator checklist, stakeholder brief, and HTML
  report, behind a stable JSON schema (`diff-analysis-v1`).
- Parser paths for Cisco IOS/IOS XE, Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch, EdgeOS/VyOS,
  Palo Alto PAN-OS, Juniper Junos, Fortinet FortiOS, UniFi controller JSON
  exports, and a generic fallback.
- `cutsheet-cli explain`, the offline diff CLI for one-off change review.
- Server platform: device registry, git-backed snapshot store, polling
  scheduler, and the analysis pipeline from snapshot changes to recorded
  findings (SQLite).
- Read-only collectors: `file` (fixtures and demo), `ssh` (vendor presets,
  host key verification), `unifi` (UniFi Network controller API), and
  `eero` (unofficial eero cloud API with out-of-band session token).
- Credential encryption at rest (NaCl secretbox) for passwords, private
  keys, and session tokens.
- REST API with bearer token auth (`cutsheet token create`) and on-demand
  snapshots.
- Severity-filtered webhook and Discord notifications.
- React web UI (timeline, devices, change detail, settings), embedded into
  the server binary via go:embed with SPA fallback.
- Zero-hardware demo mode seeding sample devices and analyzed changes.
- Docker image and compose deployment with healthcheck and non-root user.
- Version injection: `make build`, `make docker-build`, and the compose
  build report `git describe` (or `$VERSION`) via `/healthz`.
- cutsheet.dev landing page.
